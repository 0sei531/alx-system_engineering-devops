:# Using APIs: A Guide

## Reading API Documentation to Find Endpoints

When working with APIs, understanding their endpoints is crucial. Here's how you can navigate API documentation to find the endpoints you're looking for:

- Look for documentation provided by the API provider, which typically includes:
  - A list of available endpoints.
  - Descriptions of each endpoint's purpose.
  - Required parameters.
  - Example requests and responses.
- Pay attention to authentication methods required to access the endpoints.

## Using an API with Pagination

Pagination allows you to retrieve large datasets from an API in manageable chunks. Here's how to handle pagination:

- Check API documentation for pagination support and implementation details.
- Typically, the API response includes metadata indicating:
  - Total number of results.
  - Links to the next and previous pages.
- Use a loop to make successive API requests for each page until all data is retrieved.

## Parsing JSON Results from an API

Most modern APIs return data in JSON format. Here's how to parse JSON results:

- Use a programming language's built-in JSON parsing capabilities (e.g., `json` module in Python).
- Parse the JSON response into a data structure (e.g., dictionary or list).
- Access specific data elements by navigating through the parsed JSON object.

## Making a Recursive API Call

Recursive API calls are useful for hierarchical data or when pagination needs to be handled recursively. Here's how to make a recursive API call:

- Define a function that makes the API call and processes the response.
- Check if further API calls are needed based on the response.
- Call the function recursively if more data needs to be fetched.

## Sorting a Dictionary by Value

Sorting a dictionary by its values is a common task. Here's how to do it in Python:

```python
my_dict = {'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}
sorted_dict = {k: v for k, v in sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])}
print(sorted_dict)  # Output: {'b': 1, 'c': 2, 'a': 3}
