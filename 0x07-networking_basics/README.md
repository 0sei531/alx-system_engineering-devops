OSI Model:

What it is: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.

How many layers it has: It has seven layers, from the physical layer (Layer 1) to the application layer (Layer 7).

How it is organized: The layers are organized in a hierarchical order, and each layer serves a specific function. The layers are Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

LAN (Local Area Network):

What it is: A LAN is a network that is limited to a small geographic area, such as a single building or a campus.

Typical usage: LANs are commonly used for connecting computers and devices within an organization, facilitating resource sharing and communication.

Typical geographical size: Covers a small geographic area, like a single building or campus.

WAN (Wide Area Network):

What it is: A WAN is a network that covers a broad area, often connecting multiple LANs across long distances.

Typical usage: WANs are used to connect geographically dispersed networks, enabling communication between different offices or branches of an organization.

Typical geographical size: Spans a large geographic area, potentially covering cities, countries, or even continents.

Internet:

What it is: The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and networks, allowing worldwide communication and information exchange.
IP Address:

What is an IP address: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

What are the 2 types of IP address: IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).

localhost:

What is localhost: It is a hostname that refers to the current device used to access its own network services.
Subnet:

What is a subnet: A subnet is a division of an IP network into sub-networks to improve performance and security.
Why IPv6 was created:

IPv6 was created to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses due to the rapid growth of the Internet.
TCP/UDP:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Provides faster, connectionless communication.

Two Mainly Used Data Transfer Protocols for IP:

TCP and UDP.
Main Difference Between TCP and UDP:

TCP is connection-oriented, ensuring reliable data delivery with error checking and retransmission. UDP is connectionless, providing faster but less reliable data delivery without error checking.
Port:

A port is a communication endpoint used in networking to identify a specific process to which the data should be sent.
Port Numbers:

SSH: 22
HTTP: 80
HTTPS: 443
Tool/Protocol to Check if a Device is Connected to a Network:

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) and tools like Ping are often used to check the connectivity of a device on a network.
